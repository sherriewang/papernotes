# Automated crop field extraction from multi-temporal Web Enabled Landsat Data

## Highlights
> Semi-automated approaches, such as land cover classification, are challenged by factors including within-field spectral variability (caused by spatial variations in soil moisture, salinity, fertility and nutrient limitations, pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer treatment, pollution, pests and diseases) and the temporal variability and spectral similarity between crops and non-crops as a function of their phenological stage, degree of soil background, and the time of satellite observation.
